# Challenge 
Students often struggle with managing their finances efficiently due to a lack of budgeting skills, unexpected expenses, and limited income sources. Many overspend on non-essential items, leading to financial stress and difficulties in paying tuition, rent, or other essential bills. Without proper tracking, they miss due dates, accumulate debt, and fail to save, making financial planning a major challenge during university life.


# UFinance – Student Finance Management App
# Project Description
  UFinance is a student finance management app designed to help university students track their expenses, manage their budgets, and make secure transactions efficiently. The app allows users to add funds from multiple sources, such as debit cards, credit cards, or mobile wallets. With an intuitive budgeting feature, students can allocate specific amounts for essential expenses, including tuition, rent, food, and entertainment.
  To simplify financial management, the app includes a bill payment feature that enables students to pay tuition fees, rent, and other recurring expenses directly from the platform. Additionally, an AI-powered assistant helps students create a personalized monthly budget by analyzing their spending habits and providing smart financial recommendations.
